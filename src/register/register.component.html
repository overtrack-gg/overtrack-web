    <h3>Before you begin</h3>
    <p>
        To track games OverTrack records your screen and uses computer vision to detect kills, scores, SRs and more. <br/>
        This means OverTrack uses a small amount of CPU usage in the background - for mid-high end PCs this is not an issue but for low end PCs OverTrack can significantly decrease FPS or even fail to record entirely. <br/>
        Generally, the performance impact of OverTrack is less than that of OBS, but this may vary.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally because OverTrack collects data from watching the screen, it is an imperfect method. OverTrack is constantly improving to better track your Overwatch gameplay. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that on Windows 7 OverTrack is unable to track Overwatch when it is running in fullscreen mode.
        Overwatch must also be run in English with the killfeed enabled.
    </p>

    <h3>Subscription</h3>
    <p>
        To cover development costs, OverTrack asks for subscription of $4.99 US / month (following a trial period) in order to maintain full access to game details.<br/>
        Your trial period will start when you first play a game with OverTrack running and last for 1 week or 10 games, whichever happens second.
    </p>

    <h3>Using OverTrack</h3>
    <p>
        In order to correctly track everything correctly, OverTrack needs to see specific screens in Overwatch. <br/>
        To track games, try to ensure that OverTrack sees the teams list at the start of each competitive game. 
        If Overwatch is minimized while you are queued then OverTrack may be unable to see the player list - prefer using Alt-Enter to toggle fullscreen mode between games than Alt-Tabbing away from the game when in fullscreen mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        To track SR you need to visit the 'Play Menu' (where the SR is visible below 'Competitive') between each game, and allow OverTrack a second to record the SR.
    </p>
    <p>
        To check OverTrack is picking up Overwatch hover over the taskbar icon to see OverTrack's status.<br/>
