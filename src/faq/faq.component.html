    <h3 id="is-that-legal">Is OverTrack a cheat?</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12 alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            Blizzard's current stance on third party programs is unclear. Some third party programs with similar functionality to OverTrack have been forbidden, although no bans or warnings have been reported stemming from the use of OverTrack.<br>
        </div>
        <p>
        <!-- Blizzard has confirmed that they don't consider OverTrack a cheat and are fine with it.<br/> -->
        OverTrack behaves just like any other screen recording software e.g. OBS, Shadowplay. It does not interact with Overwatch and does not inject, modify or read Overwatch's memory, code or data files.<br/>
        Data is only uploaded after a game has completed, so OverTrack has no way of providing an advantage while in game.

    <h3 id="failed-to-execute">How do I solve 'Failed to execute script wrapper' when launching OverTrack?</h3>
    <img src="assets\images\faq\wrapper.png" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
    <p>
        Download and install <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">vc_redist.x64.exe</a> from Microsoft.<br/>
        This issue can also be caused if you have non-english characters in your username.<br/>
        If the problem persists join the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a> and ask for help there.

    <br/>
    <h3 id="install">Where does OverTrack install to?</h3>
    <p>
        OverTrack installs to "%appdata%\overtrack" and should be available under all programs > OverTrack launcher.<br/>
        To stop using OverTrack, you can remove it through "Add or remove programs" or just disable 'Launch on Startup' in the Settings menu in from the taskbar.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="not-tracking">OverTrack is not picking up Overwatch</h3>
    <p>
        OverTrack can have difficulty picking up Overwatch for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overwatch is being run as admin, but OverTrack is not.</li>
        <li>Overwatch is being run in fullscreen mode on Windows 7. Windows 7 fullscreen capture requires using <a href="#obs" class="scrollto">OBS Capture</a>.</li>
        <li>You are using a laptop with switchable graphics and running Overwatch on the dedicated GPU. Laptop fullscreen capture requires using <a href="#obs" class="scrollto">OBS Capture</a>.</li>
        <li>Overwatch is not being run in 16:9 aspect aspect ratio (ingame setting).</li>
        <li>You have an in-game overlay (e.g. ShadowPlay overlay, Discord Overlay, Windows registration text). Either disable this overlay or use <a href="#obs" class="scrollto">OBS Capture</a>.</li>
        <li>Overwatch is not set to English.</li>
        <li>The killfeed is disabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="how">How does OverTrack work?</h3>
    <p>
        OverTrack applies Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques to analyse and extract information from what is displayed onscreen. 
        This allows OverTrack to track information such as match SR, map, killfeed and tab-screen statistics not directly provided by Blizzard. 
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="obs">OBS Integration</h3>
    <p>
        To use OBS capture mode will need to run OBS alongside OverTrack, with a plugin installed allowing OverTrack to use OBS's capture method.<br/><br/>

        Download <code>obs-screenshot-plugin.dll</code> from <a href="https://github.com/synap5e/obs-screenshot-plugin/releases/">the releases page</a> 
        and install it to <code>C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit</code><br/>
        Relaunch OBS and ensure you have a source for your game (game capture or capture card) then right click your target source and select Filters then add a Screenshot Filter:<br/>
        <img src="assets\images\faq\add-filter.png" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><br/>

        Select the Destination type Output to <code>Named Shared Memory</code> and, the Shared Memory Name to <code>overtrack:overwatch</code> or <code>overtrack</code>(for autoselecting game) and the Interval to 1.0<br/>
        <img src="assets\images\faq\screenshot-filter.png" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><br/>

        If the source is a display capture, capture card, or game capture for "any fullscreen application" and you used the name <code>overtrack</code> and OverTrack will attempt to automatically detect the game.
        It does this by checking for the main menu periodically. You may need to wait at most 5s in the main menu for OverTrack to pick up the OBS source fully. 
        Once seen, OverTrack should show that the source is Shared Memory in the Status Window. If the source is a game capture for a specific game and using the name <code>overtrack:overwatch</code> it will override the autodetection.<br/>

        Do not create multiple filters with the same shared memory name.<br/><br/>
        
        To check if OBS capture is working, enable the Status Window and look for the text OBS shmem in the image, or SharedMemorySource in the text.

    <h3 id="suggestions">I have a suggestion/feature request for OverTrack. How should I make it known?</h3>
    <p>
        Please join our <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">Discord</a> and come chat in #support-and-feedback.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="stutter">OverTrack is causing stutter/frame drops</h3>
    <p>
        Stutter/frame drops can be caused by OverTrack's fullsceen capture method - specifically if you are using multiple monitors and playing media on a secondary monitor while playing Overwatch, although it can also occur without this.<br/>
        Using <a href="#obs" class="scrollto">OBS Capture</a> will mitigate this issue.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="missing-sr">OverTrack is missing my SR for games</h3>
    <p>
        In order to track SR, make sure you are visiting the play menu before and after each game so OverTrack can capture the SR. 
        If OverTrack missed the SR for a game you can manually provide it using the 'Edit' button on games.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="bad-name">I have a game showing up under the wrong account/in another tab in the games list</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes OverTrack can have trouble working out the name of a player that a game belongs to. 
        This can happen if you were alt-tabbed out when the game started. To fix games with the wrong player name you can use the 'Edit' button to change the account name a game is associated with.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="unknown-name">My games/some of my games show up under an account beginning with @</h3>
    <p>
        OverTrack is unable to read special characters in player names - if your account has special characters your games will show up under '@battletag'.<br/>
        You can also let OverTrack use the battletag from your currently logged in Battle.net account by <a href="#battletag" class="scrollto">enabling "Read Battletag From Blizzard App"</a><br/>.
        If your account does not have special characters this could be caused by OverTrack having difficulty detecting the correct player name. Use the 'Edit' button to correct these games, and report the issue through discord if this happens frequently.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3 id="other-unknown-names">Why are some players @UNKNONWN_BLUE#0 or @UNKNONWN_RED#1?</h3>
    <p>
        @UNKNOWN names appear for players who use special characters as part of their battletags.
    </p>

    <h3 id="universal-c">How do I solve 'Entry Point Not Found'?</h3>
    <img src="assets\images\faq\universal-c.png" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
    <p>
        Make sure your Windows is up to date with windows update.
    </p>
 
    <br/>
    <h3 id="api">I would like to have programmatic access to the data from my games recorded by OverTrack</h3>
    <p>
        Feel free to use the same API used by this website. For help or advice please get in touch through the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a>.
    </p> 

    <br/>
    <h3 id="cost">Why does OverTrack cost?</h3>
    <p>
        OverTrack is something that I have spent many months of fulltime development on, and something that I want to continue to build and support.<br/>
        Subscribing to OverTrack supports the development and server costs and is what allows OverTrack to function and to keep growing and improving.
